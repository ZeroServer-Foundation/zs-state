# zs-state


The goal of this package is to provide a unified abstraction for all state/persistence needs so that the backend can be proxied in a way that is usable for Pyodide deployments.

This allows environments such as Shinylive to operate over a ZeroServer data mesh and have access to persistence in a pluggable way.
